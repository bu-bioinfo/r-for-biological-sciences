## Basic Types: Numeric

* A single number e.g. `1.0` or `1e-5` for $10^{-5}$
* No distinction between fractional (e.g. `1.123`) and integer numbers (`1`)
* `TRUE`/`FALSE` - *Logical* or *boolean* values
  - `TRUE` stored as the number `1`
  - `FALSE` stored as the number `0`
  - Non-zero numbers considered "true" in R, zero considered "false"
* `Inf`/`-Inf` - *Infinity* - special type that indicates division by 0
* `NaN` - "impossible" value for the expression `0/0`
* **complex numbers** - R can store complex numbers using the `complex` function

## Missingness

* R can handle missing values
* `NA` - a special value that indicates a value is missing
* `NULL`. Similar to `NA`, `NULL` indicates that a vector, rather than a value, is missing
* More on vectors later

## `NA`, `NaN`, and `Inf`

* R cannot perform computations on `NA`, `NaN`, or `Inf` values
* These values have an 'infectious' quality to them
* When mixed in with other values, the result of the computation reverts to the first
of these values encountered:

## Other Types

* **factors** - Factors are a complex type used in statistical models and are
covered in greater detail later
* **character data** - `"value"`. R can store character data in the form of
strings. Note R does not interpret string values by default, so `"1"` and `1`
are distinct.
* **dates and times** - basic type to store dates and times (together
termed a *datetime*, which includes both components
  - Internally, R stores datetimes as the fractional number of days since
    January 1, 1970, using negative numbers for earlier dates.

# Data Structures {#prog-struct}

## Vectors

* Data structures in R (and other languages) are ways of storing and organizing
more than one value together
* Most basic data structure in R is a one dimensional sequence of values called a
[vector](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/vector):

  ```r
  # the c() function creates a vector
  x <- c(1,2,3)
  [1] 1 2 3
  ```

* The vector in R has a special property that *all values contained in the vector
must have the same type*

## Vectors continued

* When constructing a vector, R will [coerce
  values](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/r-objects.html#coercion) to
  the most general type if it encounters values of different types:

  ```r
  c(1,2,"3")
  [1] "1" "2" "3"
  c(1,2,TRUE,FALSE)
  [1] 1 2 1 0
  c(1,2,NA) # note missing values stay missing
  [1] 1 2 NA
  c("1",2,NA,NaN) # NA stays, NaN is cast to a character type
  [1] "1" "2" NA "NaN"
  ```

## Vectors continued

* vectors also have a length, which is defined as the number of elements in the vector

  ```r
  x <- c(1,2,3)
  length(x)
  [1] 3
  ```

## Vector operations

* R is much more efficient at operating on vectors than individual elements
  separately
* With numeric vectors, you can perform arithmetic operations on vectors of
compatible size just as easily as individual values

  ```r
  c(1,2) + c(3,4)
  [1] 4 6
  c(1,2) * c(3,4)
  [1] 3 8
  ```

## Vector arithmetic warning!

* R multiplies vectors of different length in a strange way:

  ```r
  c(1,2) * c(3,4,5) # lengths 2 and 3 not evenly divisible!
  [1] 3 8 5
  Warning message:
  In c(1, 2) * c(3, 4, 5) :
    longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object length
  ```

* Cycles through values in each vector until all values are used
* Above, `c(1,2) * c(3,4,5)`  yields: $1*3$, $2*4$, $1*5$, **weird!**
* When the vector lengths *are* evenly divisible, no warning raised:

  ```r
  c(1,2) * c(3,4,5,6) # yields: 1*3 2*4 1*5 2*6
  [1] 3 8 5 12
  ```

## Factors

* Factors are objects that R uses to handle categorical variables
  - i.e. variables that can take one of a distinct set of values for each sample
* We create a factor from a vector of character strings using the [`factor()`
  function](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/factor)

  ```r
  case_status <- factor(
    c('Disease','Disease','Disease',
      'Control','Control','Control'
    )
  )
  case_status
  [1] Disease Disease Disease Control Control Control
  Levels: Control Disease
  ```

## Factors are numeric vectors

* The distinct values in the factor are called *levels*
* Internally, a factor is stored as a vector of integers where each level has
  the same value:

  ```r
  as.numeric(case_status)
  [1] 2 2 2 1 1 1
  str(case_status)
   Factor w/ 2 levels "Control","Disease": 2 2 2 1 1 1
  ```

* By default, R assigns integers to levels in alphanumeric order
  - e.g. `"Control"` is set to 1, `"Disease"` is set to 2

## Changing Factor Level Numbers

* You can change which levels are assigned to which number
* The integers assigned to each level can be specified explicitly when creating
  the factor:

  ```r
  case_status <- factor(
    c('Disease','Disease','Disease','Control','Control','Control'),
    levels=c('Disease','Control')
  )
  case_status
  [1] Disease Disease Disease Control Control Control
  Levels: Control Disease
  str(case_status)
   Factor w/ 2 levels "Disease","Control": 1 1 1 2 2 2
  ```

## Character data are loaded as factors

* The base R functions `read.csv`/`read.table` load columns with character
  values as factors by default
* You may turn this off with `stringsAsFactors=FALSE` to `read.csv()`
* You may change the level mapping of an existing factor by *releveling* it
  by passing a factor into the `factor()` function and specifying new levels

  ```r
  str(case_status)
   Factor w/ 2 levels "Disease","Control": 1 1 1 2 2 2
  factor(case_status, levels=c("Control","Disease"))
   Factor w/ 2 levels "Control","Disease": 2 2 2 1 1 1
  ```
  
## Matrices

* A matrix in R is simply the 2 dimensional version of a vector
* i.e. a rectangle of values that all have the same type, e.g. number, character,
  logical, etc.
* Constructed using the vector notation described above and specifying the
  number of rows and columns the matrix should have
* Instead of having a length like a vector, it has $m \times n$ dimensions

## Matrix construction example

```r
# create a matrix with two rows and three columns containing integers
A <- matrix(c(1,2,3,4,5,6)
       nrow = 2, ncol = 3, byrow=1
      )
A
[,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]    1    2    3
[2,]    4    5    6
dim(A) # prints out the dimensions of the matrix, rows first
[1] 2 3
```

## Transposing matrices

* Matrices can be transposed from $m \times n$ to be $n \times m$ using the
  `t()` function

  ```r
  A
  [,1] [,2] [,3]
  [1,]    1    2    3
  [2,]    4    5    6
  t(A)
  [,1] [,2]
  [1,]    1    4
  [2,]    2    5
  [3,]    3    6
  dim(t(A))
  [1] 3 2
  ```

## Lists and data frames

* Vectors and matrices have the special property that all items must be of the
  same type
* Lists and data frames are data structures that do not have this requirement
* Lists and data frames are both one dimensional sequences of values

## Lists

* Lists can be created using the `list()` function:

  ```r
  my_list <- list(
    c(1,2,3),
    c("A","B","C","D")
  )
  my_list
  [[1]]
  [1] 1 2 3

  [[2]]
  [1] "A" "B" "C" "D"
  my_list[[1]] # access the first item of the list
  [1] 1 2 3
  my_list[[2]] # access the second item of the list
  [1] "A" "B" "C" "D"
  ```

## List entries can have names

* Lists can also be defined and indexed by name:

  ```r
  my_list <- list(
    numbers=c(1,2,3),
    categories=c("A","B","C","D")
  )
  my_list
  $numbers
  [1] 1 2 3

  $categories
  [1] "A" "B" "C" "D"
  my_list$numbers # access the first item of the list
  [1] 1 2 3
  my_list$categories # access the second item of the list
  [1] "A" "B" "C" "D"
  ```

## Data frames

* Lists and data frames are the same underlying data structure
* The elements of a data frame must all have the same length
* The elements of a list do not need to have all the same length

## Creating data frames

* You may create a data frame with `data.frame()`:

  ```r
  my_df <- data.frame( # recall '.' has no special meaning in R
    numbers=c(1,2,3),
    categories=c("A","B","C","D")
  )
  Error in data.frame(c(1, 2, 3), c("A", "B", "C", "D")) :
    arguments imply differing number of rows: 3, 4
  my_df <- data.frame(
    numbers=c(1,2,3),
    categories=c("A","B","C")
  )
  my_df
    numbers categories
  1       1          A
  2       2          B
  3       3          C
  ```
  
# Naming Data Structures

## Naming Data Structures

* Vectors, matrices, lists, and data frames can have names assigned to their indices
* For vectors and lists, these names are one-dimensional vectors of characters
* Assignable and accessible using the `names()` function:

```r
x <- c(1,2,3)
names(x) # vectors have no names by default
NULL
names(x) <- c("a","b","c")
x
a b c
1 2 3
names(x)
[1] "a" "b" "c"
```

## Naming Lists

* Lists names are accessible and assignable similarly to vectors:

```r
l <- list(a=3.5, b=0.4, c=c(9.1, 5.8), d=7.7)
names(l)
[1] "a" "b" "c" "d"
names(l) <- c("f1", "f2", "f3", "f4")
l
$f1
[1] 3.5

$f2
[1] 0.4

$f3
[1] 9.1 5.8

$f4
[1] 7.7
```

## Naming Matrices and Data frames

* Matrices and data frames also have both rows and columns
* They can have `rownames` and `colnames`

```r
m <- matrix(1:9, nrow=3, byrow=T)
colnames(m) <- c("c1", "c2", "c3")
rownames(m) <- c("r1", "r2", "r3")
m
   c1 c2 c3
r1  1  2  3
r2  4  5  6
r3  7  8  9
m["r1",] # get row 1
c1 c2 c3 
 1  2  3 
m[, "c2"] # get column 2
r1 r2 r3 
 2  5  8 
```

# Subsetting

## Subsetting

* Each of the data structures in R are collections of objects
* We often would like to select a subset of elements in a collection that have
  certain properties
  - e.g. numeric values less than a specific threshold
* Selecting out a subset of elements in a data structure is called *subsetting*
* R provides many different methods to subset a data structure depending on the
  type of data structure

## 0- vs 1-based indexing

* R uses *1-based indexing*
* First item in any data structure is referenced with the index 1:

```r
x <- c(3.5, 0.4, 9.1, 7.7)
x[1]
[1] 3.5
x[4]
[1] 7.7
x[0] # this always returns an empty vector
[1] numeric(0)
x[5] # accessing indices larger than the vector length returns NA
[1] NA
```

## 0- vs 1-based indexing

* C and python use *0-based indexing*
* First item in a data structure is referenced with the index 0:

```python
x = [3.5, 0.4, 9.1, 7.7]
print(x[0])
3.5
print(x[3])
7.7
print(x[4]) # accessing indices larger than the list length raises error
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
IndexError: list index out of range
```

## Subsetting Vectors

There are six different ways to subset vectors in R. The following three are the
most common:

* **Positive integers**: return specific elements by integer index.
* **Negative integers**: omit specific elements by their negative integer index.
* **Logical vectors**: return specific elements where the indexing vector is `TRUE`

## Subsetting Vectors: Positive Integers

* **Positive integers**: return specific elements by integer index.

```r
x <- c(3.5, 0.4, 9.1, 7.7)
x[1]
[1] 3.5
x[c(1,3)] # can subset using a vector of integers
[1] 3.5 9.1
x[c(1,1)] # can select the same element multiple times
[1] 3.5 3.5
```
  
## Subsetting Vectors: Positive Integers

* **Negative integers**: omit specific elements by their negative integer index.

```r
x <- c(3.5, 0.4, 9.1, 7.7)
x[-1] # return all but the first element
[1] 0.4 9.1 7.7
x[-c(2,4)] # return the first and third element
[1] 3.5 9.1
```
  
## Subsetting Vectors: Logical Vectors

* **Logical vectors**: return specific elements where the indexing vector is `TRUE`

```r
x <- c(3.5, 0.4, 9.1, 7.7)
x[c(TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE)]
[1] 3.5
x[c(FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE)]
[1] 0.4 9.1
x > 3
[1] TRUE FALSE TRUE TRUE
x[x > 3]
[1] 3.5 9.1 7.7
```
  
## Subsetting Matrices

* Matrices may be subset using the same methods as vectors
* Also, because matrices also have a notion of rows and columns,
they may also be subset by pairs of vectors that select either rows or columns
* Syntax: `x[<row selectors>, <column selectors>]`
* `selectors` may be any of the methods used to subset a vector

## Subsetting Matrices

```r
x <- matrix(1:9, nrow=3, byrow=TRUE)
x
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]    1    2    3
[2,]    4    5    6
[3,]    7    8    9
x[c(1,2), c(1,2)] # first two rows, first two columns
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]    1    2
[2,]    4    5
```

## Subsetting Matrices

```r
x[-c(1,3), ] # leaving a selector blank selects all, second row and all columns
[1] 4 5 6
x[, c(2,3)] # all rows included, last two columns
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]    2    3
[2,]    5    6
[3,]    8    9
x[-c(1,3), c(2)] # select the second row and second column
[1] 5
```

## Subsetting Lists

* A list can be subset with all the same methods as a vector

```r
l <- list(3.5, 0.4, c(9.1, 5.8), 7.7))
l[1]
[[1]]
[1] 3.5
l[c(2,3)]
[[1]]
[1] 0.4

[[2]]
[1] 9.1 5.8
```

## Subsetting Lists

```r
l[c(FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)]
[[1]]
[1] 0.4

[[2]]
[1] 9.1 5.8
```

Note: when indexing a list with `[`, the result returned is always another
list; we will discuss this more later.

## Subsetting Lists by Name

* Named lists may be accessed by name

```r
l <- list(a=3.5, b=0.4, c=c(9.1, 5.8), d=7.7)
l["a"]
$a
[1] 3.5
l[c("a","c")]
$a
[1] 3.5

$c
[1] 9.1 5.8
l[c("b")]
```

## Data frames

* Data frames may be accessed like both vectors (and therefore lists)
* Also like matrices, since they are rectangular by construction

## `[[` and `$`

* `[[` and `$` operators are used to access single items of data structures
individual value of a list or data frame and return only that value,
* We use `[[` when indexing by integer or name:

```r
l <- list(a=3.5, b=0.4, c=c(9.1, 5.8), d=7.7)

l[1] # returns a list with a single value of 3.5
[[1]]
[1] 3.5
l[[1]] # returns 3.5
[1] 3.5
l[[3]] # returns c(9.1, 5.8)
[1] 9.1 5.8
```

## `[[` and `$`

```r
l["a"] # returns list(a=3.5)
$a
[1] 3.5
l$a # returns 3.5
[1] 3.5
l[["a"]] # also returns 3.5
[1] 3.5
```

# Functions

## Functions Intro

* A *function* is a symbolic representation of code
* R provides [very large number of functions](https://rdrr.io/r/) for common operations
* You can (will, and should) write your own functions
* Functions are useful for:
  1. Making your code more concise and readable
  2. Allow you to avoid writing the same code over and over (i.e. reuse it)
  3. Allow you to systematically test pieces of your code
  4. Allow you to share your code easily with others
  5. Program using a functional programming style

## Functional Programming

* R is a *functional programming language*
* Emphasizes using functions
* Advantages of programs written in functional programming languages
  * Concise
  * Predictable
  * Provably correct
  * Performant (e.g. easily parallelizable)

## Function Definitions

* Functions usually accept and execute on different inputs
* e.g. the `mean` function wouldn't be very useful if it didn't accept a value

  ```r
  mean(c(1,2,3))
  [1] 2
  ```
* The function must *accept* or allow you to *pass it arguments*

  ```r
  # a basic function signature
  function_name(arg1, arg2) # function accepts 2 arguments
  ```

## Function Terminology

```r
# a basic function signature
function_name(arg1, arg2) # function accepts 2 arguments
```

* `arg1` and `arg2` are *arguments* indicating this function accepts two arguments
* `function_name` is the name of the function
* The pattern of arguments it accepts is called the function's *signature.*
* Every function has at least one signature
* `arg1` and `arg2` are *positional* arguments (i.e. order matters)

## Most Functions Require Passed Arguments

* Functions will raise an error if they don't receive arguments they expect:

  ```r
  mean() # compute the arithmetic mean, but of what?
  Error in mean.default() : argument "x" is missing, with no default
  ```
* The specific arguments a function accepts is called the function *signature*
* You can find details about a function signatures using the documentation, as described next

## R Function Documentation

<div class="centered">
<img src="../rstudio_help_fn_sigs.png" style="width: 90%"/>
</div>

## R Function Signatures

* These are the function signatures for the `mean()` function:

  ```r
  mean(x, ...)

  ## Default S3 method:
  mean(x, trim = 0, na.rm = FALSE, ...)
  ```

* This function has two signatures
* The names of the arguments in the signature (e.g. `x`) are the variable names
  the function uses in its code to refer to the parameters you pass
* The named arguments in a function signature are called *parameters* or
  *formal arguments*

## R Function Signatures Continued

```r
mean(x, ...)

## Default S3 method:
mean(x, trim = 0, na.rm = FALSE, ...)
```

* The second signature of the `mean` function introduces two new types of syntax:
  * **Default argument values** - e.g. `trim = 0` named arguments that have a
    default value if not provided explicitly.
  * **Variable arguments** - `...`. This means the `mean` function can accept
    arguments that are not explicitly listed in the signature. This syntax is
    called [dynamic dots](https://rlang.r-lib.org/reference/dyn-dots.html).

## R Function Arguments

<div class="centered">
<img src="../rstudio_mean_fn_args.png" style="width: 60%"/>
</div>

## Specifying Arguments By Name

* All function arguments can be specified by name

  ```r
  # generate 100 normally distributed samples with mean 0 and
  # standard deviation 1
  my_vals <- rnorm(100,mean=0,sd=1)
  mean(my_vals)
  [1] -0.05826857
  mean(x=my_vals)
  [1] -0.05826857
  ```

* To borrow from [the Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/#id2):

  > "Explicit is better than implicit."

* Passing arguments with their names can help avoid bugs!

## Beware of `...` dynamic dots

* **The `...` argument catchall can be very dangerous.**
* It allows you to provide arguments to a function that have no meaning...
* and R will not raise an error:

  ```r
  # generates 100 normally distributed samples with mean 0 and
  # standard deviation 1
  my_vals <- rnorm(100,mean=0,sd=1)
  mean(x=my_vals,tirm=0.1)
  [1] -0.05826857
  ```

* Did you spot the mistake?

## Beware of `...` dynamic dots

```r
# generates 100 normally distributed samples with mean 0 and
# standard deviation 1
my_vals <- rnorm(100,mean=0,sd=1)
mean(x=my_vals,tirm=0.1)
[1] -0.05826857
mean(x=my_vals,trim=0.1)
[1]-0.02139839
```

## Writing your own functions

* R allows you to define your own functions
* Example that adds two arguments together:

  ```r
  sum_args <- function(arg1, arg2) {
    # code that does something with arg1, arg2, etc
    some_result <- arg1 + arg2
    return(some_result) # explicit return
  }

  sum_args <- function(arg1, arg2) {
    # code that does something with arg1, arg2, etc
    arg1 + arg2 # implicit return is last expression in function
  }
  ```

* You choose function name, arguments, implementation

## Custom function definition example

* Example for `standardize()` function:

  ```r
  standardize <- function(x) {
    res <- (x - mean(x))/sd(x)
    return(res)
  }

  my_vals <- rnorm(100,mean=20,sd=10)
  my_vals_std <- standardize(my_vals)
  c(mean(my_vals_std), sd(my_vals_std))
  [1] 0 1

  my_other_vals <- rnorm(100,mean=40,sd=5)
  my_other_vals_std <- standardize(my_other_vals)
  c(mean(my_other_vals_std), sd(my_other_vals_std))
  [1] 0 1
  ```

## A Note On Returning Values

* The `return()` function is not strictly necessary in R

  ```r
  standardize <- function(x) {
    res <- (x - mean(x))/sd(x)
    return(res)
  }
  ```

* The result of the last line of code executed in the body of a function is
  returned by default
* However, to again to borrow from [the Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/#id2):

  > "Explicit is better than implicit."

* Being explicit about what a function returns by using the `return()` function
  will make your code less error prone and easier to understand

## Scope

* In programming, every variable you define has a *scope*
* A variable's scope defines which parts of the code have access to that variable
* A variable with *universal* or *top-level scope* can be accessed anywhere in a
  program
* Variables defined *inside* functions can only be accessed from within that
  function

## Scope continued

```r
x <- 3
multiply_x_by_two <- function() {
  # x is defined outside the function
  # but is inside this function's scope
  y <- x*2
  return(y)
}
```

* `x` and `multiply_x_by_two` have universal scope
* `y` scope is limited to within the `multiply_x_by_two` function

## Scope continued

* The `multiply_x_by_two` function accesses `x` from the *outer scope*

  ```r
  x <- 3
  multiply_x_by_two <- function() {
    # x is defined outside the function
    # but is inside this function's scope
    y <- x*2
    return(y)
  }
  ```
* In general, **accessing variables within functions from outside the function's scope is very
bad practice!**

## Scope continued

* Functions should be as self contained as possible, any values they need should be passed as parameters
* This is better:

  ```r
  x <- 3
  multiply_by_two <- function(x) {
    # x is now bound to the formal argument to the function
    # not x in the outer scope
    y <- x*2
    y
  }
  ```

##  Iteration

* Iteration refers to stepping sequentially through a set or collection of
  objects
* In non-functional languages like python, C, etc. there are particular *control
  structures* that implement iteration, commonly called *loops*
* E.g. `for` and `while` loops in python/Java/C
* R has these features, but is designed to iterate in a *functional* way
* Iteration in R should be done in two ways:
  - vectorized operations
  - functional programming with `apply()`

## Warning about loops in R

* Note that R does have `for` and `while` loop support in the language
* However, these loop structures can have poor performance
* Preference should generally be given to the functional style of iteration

  [How To Avoid For Loops in R](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2018/09/how-to-avoid-for-loop-in-r/)

* If you really, really want to learn how to use for loops in R, read this, but
  don't say I didn't warn you when your code slows to a crawl for unknown reasons:

  [R for Data Science - for loops](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/iteration.html#for-loops)

## Vectorized operations

* R knows how to perform many operations on vectors and matrices as well as
  individual values

  ```r
  x <- c(1,2,3,4,5)
  x + 3 # add 3 to every element of vector x
  [1] 4 5 6 7 8
  ```

* Equivalent python:

  ```python
  x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  # list comprehension
  new_x = [x_i+3 for x_i in x]
  # for loop
  new_x = []
  for x_i in x:
    new_x.append(x_i+3)
  ```

## Vectorized operations on matrices

* Matrices also support element-wise operations

  ```r
  x_mat <- matrix(c(1,2,3,4,5,6),nrow=2,ncol=3)
  x_mat + 3 # add 3 to every element of matrix x_mat
  [,1] [,2] [,3]
  [1,]    4    6    8
  [2,]    5    7    9
  # the * operator always means element-wise
  x_mat * x_mat
       [,1] [,2] [,3]
  [1,]    1    9   25
  [2,]    4   16   36
  ```
## Functional programming

* R is a functional programming language, designed around the use of functions
* Every function can be passed as a variable just like those bound to values
* This means functions can be passed to other functions

## Mathematical example

* Consider a general formulation of vector transformation:

$$
\bar{\mathbf{x}} = \frac{\mathbf{x} - t_r(\mathbf{x})}{s(\mathbf{x})}
$$

* $\mathbf{x}$ is a vector of real numbers
* $t_r(\mathbf{x})$ is a function that takes $\mathbf{x}$ and returns a scalar
  (e.g. a central tendency like an arithmetic mean)
* $s(\mathbf{x})$ is a function that takes $\mathbf{x}$ and computes a scalar scaling factor
* $\bar{\mathbf{x}}$ is defined as a vector of the same length where each value
  has had some average

## Mathematical example continued

$$
\bar{\mathbf{x}} = \frac{\mathbf{x} - t_r(\mathbf{x})}{s(\mathbf{x})}
$$

* There are many different ways to define the central value $t_r(\mathbf{x})$ of
  a set of numbers:

  - arithmetic mean, [geometric mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_mean),
    median, mode, [and many more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean#Other_means)

* Similarly for scaling strategies $s(\mathbf{x})$:

  - standard deviation, rescaling factor (e.g. set data range to be between -1 and 1),
    scaling to unit length (all values sum to 1), [and others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_scaling)

## Passing functions as functions

* Consider our standardization function from earlier:

  ```r
  standardize <- function(x) {
    res <- (x - mean(x))/sd(x)
    return(res)
  }
  ```

* We have hard coded `mean()` and `sd()` as our central tendency and scale functions
* We can pass these functions as parameters instead:

  ```r
  # note R already has a built in function named "transform"
  my_transform <- function(x, t_r, s) {
    return((x - t_r(x))/s(x))
  }
  ```

## Passing functions as functions

* With the `my_transform` function:

  ```r
  # note R already has a built in function named "transform"
  my_transform <- function(x, t_r, s) {
    return((x - t_r(x))/s(x))
  }
  ```

* We can perform [Z-score normalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score)
  by passing `mean` and `sd` as `t_r` and `s`, respectively:

  ```r
  x <- rnorm(100,mean=20,sd=10)
  x_zscore <- my_transform(x, mean, sd) # functions passed as arguments
  mean(x_zscore)
  [1] 0
  sd(x_zscore)
  [1] 1
  ```

## Generalized Transformation Function

* Can use any functions for `t_r` and `s` so long as they accept a vector of
  numbers as first argument:

  ```r
  x <- rnorm(100,mean=20,sd=10)
  x_transform <- my_transform(x, median, sum)
  median(x_transform)
  [1] 0
  # this quantity does not have an a priori known value
  # (or meaning for that matter, it's just an example)
  sum(x_transform)
  [1] 0.013
  ```

## Custom Transformations

* We can also write our own functions and pass them to `my_transform`
* The following scales the values of `x` to have a range of $[0,1]$:

  ```r
  data_range <- function(x) {
    return(max(x) - min(x))
  }
  # my_transform computes: (x - min(x))/(max(x) - min(x))
  x_rescaled <- my_transform(x, min, data_range)
  min(x_rescaled)
  [1] 0
  max(x_rescaled)
  [1] 1
  ```

## `apply()` and friends

* Passing functions as arguments allows us to iterate over collections
* There are three `apply()` related functions you should use:
  - `lapply(X, FUN)` - for when you want a list returned
  - `vapply(X, FUN, FUN.VALUE)` - for when you want a vector returned
  - `apply(X, FUN, MARGIN)` -  for when `X` is 2 dimensional (e.g. a matrix)
  
## Note of warning: `sapply()`

* `sapply()` is also available
* this function automatically `s`implifies the result, i.e. it "guesses" what
  type of output you want
* Can make your code unpredictable!
* Recommend against using `sapply()`!

## `vapply()` for vectors

* The `vapply()` function is used for this, with the following signature:

  ```r
  vapply(X, FUN, FUN.VALUE, ...)
  ```

* `X` is one-dimensional collection of items (i.e. a list or vector)
* `FUN` is the name of a function that can accept any of the items in the list
* `FUN.VALUE` is an example value to indicate the type of the returned vector
  (recall all items in a vector must have the same type)
* `vapply()` returns a new vector of type `typeof(FUN.VALUE)` the same length as
  `X` where each item has had the function `FUN` applied to it

## `vapply()` example

* Consider the vectorized addition from above:

  ```r
  x <- c(1,2,3,4,5)
  x + 3
  [1] 4 5 6 7 8
  ```

* We can do the equivalent operation with `vapply`

  ```r
  x <- c(1,2,3,4,5)
  add3 <- function(i) {
    i + 3
  }
  # below the 0 means we want a numeric vector back
  vapply(x, add3, 0)
  [1] 4 5 6 7 8
  ```

## Functional operations on 2 dimensions

* Recall the [Z-score transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score) defined earlier:

  ```r
  standardize <- function(x) {
    res <- (x - mean(x))/sd(x)
    return(res)
  }
  ```

* This function operates on a single vector
* We sometimes want to transform each row or column of a matrix separately
* The `apply()` function allows a function to be applied to either rows or columns
  of a 2 dimensional data structure like a matrix or data frame

## The `apply()` function

* This is the signature of the `apply` function, from the RStudio `help(apply)` page:

  ```r
  apply(X, MARGIN, FUN, ..., simplify = TRUE)
  ```

* `X` is a matrix or data frame (i.e. a rectangle of numbers)
* `MARGIN` indicates whether function should be applied on rows (`MARGIN=1`) or columns (`MARGIN=2`)
* `FUN` is the name of a function that accepts a vector and returns either a vector or a scalar value
* `apply()` then executes `FUN` on each row or column of `X` and returns the result

## `apply()` example

```r
zscore <- function(x) {
  return((x-mean(x))/sd(x))
}
# construct matrix of 50x100 normally distributed samples
x_mat <- matrix( rnorm(100*50, mean=20, sd=5),
  nrow=50,
  ncol=100
)
# z-transform the rows so that each column has mean,sd of 0,1
x_mat_zscore  <- apply(x_mat, 2, zscore)
# check columns of x_mat_zscore have mean close to zero with apply
x_mat_zscore_means <- apply(x_mat_zscore, 2, mean)
# note: due to machine precision errors, these results will not be
# exactly zero, but are very close
# note: the all() function returns true if all elements are TRUE
all(x_mat_zscore_means<1e-15)
[1] TRUE
```

## `lapply()` Function

* `lapply()` iterates over the elements of `X` and returns a list with the result

  ```r
  lapply(X, FUN, ...)
  ```

* Example:

  ```r
  x <- list(
    feature1=rnorm(100,mean=20,sd=10),
    feature2=rnorm(100,mean=50,sd=5)
  )
  x_zscore <- lapply(x, zscore)
  # check that the means are close to zero
  x_zscore_means <- lapply(x_zscore, mean)
  all(x_zscore_means < 1e-15)
  [1] TRUE
  ```
