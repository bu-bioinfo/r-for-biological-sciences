## R in Biology

* R rose in popularity when [microarray
  technology](https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Microarray-Technology)
  came into widespread use
* A community of biological researchers and data analysts created a collection
  of software packages called [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/)
* R packages form a bridge between:
  - biologists without a computational background and
  - statisticians and bioinformaticians, who invent new methods and implement
    them as R packages that are easily accessible by all

# Biological Data Overview

## Types of Biological Data

* There are five types of data used in biological data analysis:
  - raw/primary data
  - processed data
  - analysis results
  - metadata
  - annotation data

## Raw/primary data  

* The primary observations made by instruments/experiments
* Examples:
  - high-throughput sequencing data
  - mass/charge ratio data from mass spectrometry
  - 16S rRNA sequencing data from metagenomic studies
  - SNPs from genotyping assays,
* Often very large and not efficiently processed using R
* Specialized tools built outside of R are used to first process the
primary data into a form that is amenable to analysis
* The most common primary biological data types include [Microarrays], [High Throughput Sequencing] data,
and [mass spectrometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry) data

## Processed data

* The result of any analysis or transformation of primary data into an intermediate, more interpretable form
* For example, in RNASeq:
  1. short reads aligned against a genome
  2. counted against annotated genes
  3. counts form counts matrix of genes x samples
* Processed data does not need to be stored long term if the raw data and code
  to produce it is available

## Analysis results

* Analysis results aren't data *per se* but are the results of analysis of
  primary data or processed data
* Usually what we use to form interpretations of our datasets
* Therefore we must manipulate them in much the same way as any other dataset

## Metadata

* Experiments usually study multiple samples
* Each sample typically has information associated with it
* "Data that is about data" is called *metadata*
* E.g. the information about human subjects included in a study including age at
  death, whether the person had a disease, the measurements of tissue quality,
  etc. is the metadata
* The primary and processed data and metadata are usually stored in
  different files, where the metadata (or *sample information* or *sample data*,
  etc) will have one column indicating the unique identifier (ID) of each sample.
* The processed data will typically have columns named for each of the sample IDs

## Annotation data

* Includes previously determined information about biological entities, e.g. genes
* Annotation data is publicly available information about the features we measure in our experiments
* Examples:
  - genomic coordinates where genes exist
  - any known functions of those genes
  - the domains found in proteins and their relative sequence
  - gene identifier cross references across different gene naming systems
  - single nucleotide polymorphism genomic locations and associations with traits or diseases

## Information flow in biological data analysis

<img src="../information_flow.png" width="80%"/>

# CSV Files

## CSV Files

* `csv` - character separated value file
* Most common, convenient, and flexible data file format in biology and bioinformatics
* Plain text files that contain rectangular data
* Each line of these files has some number of data values separated by a consistent character
  - most commonly the comma which are called [comma-separated value, or "CSV", files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values)
* Filenames typically end with the extension `.csv`
* Other characters, especially the <Tab> character, may be used to create valid
files in this format

## Example CSV file

```
id,somevalue,category,genes
1,2.123,A,APOE
4,5.123,B,"HOXA1,HOXB1"
7,8.123,,SNCA
```

## Properties and principles of CSV files

* The first line often but not always contains the column names of each column
* Each value is delimited by the same character, in this case `,`
* Values can be any value, including numbers and characters
* When a value contains the delimiting character (e.g. HOXA1,HOXB1 contains a
  `,`), the value is wrapped in double quotes
* Values can be missing, indicated by sequential delimiters (i.e. `,,` or one
  `,` at the end of the line, if the last column value is missing)
* There is no delimiter at the end of the lines
* To be well-formatted *every line must have the same number of delimited
  values*

# Forms of Biological Data

## Common Biological Data Matrices

* *processed data* typically what we worked with in R
* Common features:
  - First row is column headers/sample names
  - First column is some *identifier* (gene symbol, genomic locus, etc)
  - Each row is a variable with sample values as columns

## Biological Data Matrix Example

```r
intensities <- readr::read_csv("example_intensity_data.csv")
intensities
# A tibble: 54,675 x 36
   probe     GSM972389 GSM972390 GSM972396 GSM972401 GSM972409
   <chr>         <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>
 1 1007_s_at      9.54     10.2       9.72      9.68      9.35
 2 1053_at        7.62      7.92      7.17      7.24      8.20
 3 117_at         5.50      5.56      5.06      7.44      5.19
 4 121_at         7.27      7.96      7.42      7.34      7.49
 5 1255_g_at      2.79      3.10      2.78      2.91      3.02
# ... with 54,665 more rows, and 26 more variables: GSM972433 <dbl>
#   GSM972487 <dbl>, GSM972488 <dbl>, GSM972489 <dbl>,
#   GSM972510 <dbl>, GSM972512 <dbl>, GSM972521 <dbl>
```

## Biological data is NOT Tidy!

* "tidy" data has the following properties:

  1. Each variable must have its own column
  2. Each observation must have its own row
  3. Each value must have its own cell

* Data from high throughput biological experiments have many more *variables*
  than *observations*!
* Biological data matrices are usually *transposed*
  - variables as rows
  - observations (i.e. samples) as columns

## Biological data is NOT Tidy!

```r
# A tibble: 54,675 x 36
   probe     GSM972389 GSM972390 GSM972396 GSM972401 GSM972409
   <chr>         <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>
 1 1007_s_at      9.54     10.2       9.72      9.68      9.35
 2 1053_at        7.62      7.92      7.17      7.24      8.20
```

##  Tidyverse works on tidy data

* Base R and tidyverse are optimized to perform computations on columns not rows
* Can perform operations on rows rather than columns, but code may perform poorly
* A couple options:

  * **Pivot into long format.**
  * **Compute row-wise statistics using `apply()`.**

    ```r
    intensity_variance <- apply(intensities, 2, var)
    intensities$variance <- intensity_variance
    ```

# Bioconductor

## Bioconductor

* [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/) is an organized collection of
strictly biological analysis methods packages
* Hosted and maintained outside of [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/)
* Maintainers enforce [rigorous coding quality, testing, and documentation
standards](https://bioconductor.org/developers/package-guidelines/)
* Bioconductor is divided into roughly two sets of packages:
  - *core maintainer* packages
  - user contributed packages

## Bioconductor: Core maintainer packages

* Core maintainer packages define a set of common objects and classes e.g.:
  - [ExpressionSet class](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/Biobase/inst/doc/ExpressionSetIntroduction.pdf)
in the [Biobase package](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Biobase.html))
* All Bioconductor packages must use these common objects and classes
* Ensures consistency among all Bioconductor packages

## Installing Bioconductor

* Bioconductor is itself a package called [BiocManager](https://www.bioconductor.org/install/)
* `BiocManager` must be installed prior to installing other Bioconductor packages
* To [install bioconductor] (note `install.packages()`):

  ```r
  if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
      install.packages("BiocManager")
  BiocManager::install(version = "3.16")
  ```

## Installing Bioconductor packages

```r
# installs the affy bioconductor package for microarray analysis
BiocManager::install("affy")
```

## Bioconductor package pages

![](affy_package_page.png){width=90%}

## Bioconductor documentation

* In addition, Biconductor provides three types of documentation:

  - [Workflow tutorials](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/workflows/) on
    how to perform specific analysis use cases
  - [Package vignettes](https://bioconductor.org/help/package-vignettes/) for
    every package, provides worked example of how to use the package
  - Detailed, consistently formatted reference documentation that gives precise
    information on functionality and use of each package


## Base Bioconductor Packages & Classes

* Base Bioconductor packages define convenient data structures for storing and
  analyzing biological data
* The `SummarizedExperiment` class stores data and metadata for an experiment

## `SummarizedExperiment` Illustration

![](https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fnmeth.3252/MediaObjects/41592_2015_Article_BFnmeth3252_Fig2_HTML.jpg?as=webp){width=80%}

## `SummarizedExperiment` Details

* `SummarizedExperiment` class is used ubiquitously throughout the Bioconductor
  package ecosystem
* `SummarizedExperiment` stores:
  - Processed data (`assays`)
  - Metadata (`colData` and `exptData`)
  - Annotation data (`rowData`)

# Gene Identifiers

## Gene Identifier Systems

* First gene sequence determined in 1965 - [an alanine
tRNA in yeast](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14263761/)
* Genes are distinct entities - how do we name them?
* In 1979, formal guidelines for human gene nomenclature proposal gave
  researchers a common vocabulary for genes
* In 1989,  Human Genome Organisation (HUGO), become HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC)
* HGNC remains the official body providing guidelines and gene naming authority
* HGNC gene names called *gene symbols*

## HGNC Gene Name Guidelines

1. Each gene is assigned a unique symbol, HGNC ID and descriptive name.
2. Symbols contain only uppercase Latin letters and Arabic numerals.
3. Symbols should not be the same as commonly used abbreviations
4. Nomenclature should not contain reference to any species or “G” for gene.
5. Nomenclature should not be offensive or pejorative.

## Gene Symbols

* Gene symbols are the most human-readable system for naming genes
* e.g. *BRCA1*, *APOE*, and *ACE2*
* Symbols are convenient for humans when reading, identifying, communicating about genes
* However, symbols may be ambiguous, and some genes have many synonymous symbols
* Other gene identifier systems evolved in parallel to address this ambiguity

## Gene symbol ambiguity: APOE

![](apoe_gene_card.png){width=100%}

## Human Gene Identifier Systems: Ensembl

* [Ensembl](https://www.ensembl.org/) Project genome browser and genome annotation
  database
* Assigns automatic, systematic ID called *Ensembl Gene ID* during genome
  annotation
* Ensembl Gene ID follows convention `ENSGNNNNNNNNNNN`, where `N` are numbers
  - e.g. APOE is `ENSG00000130203`
* Gene annotation is
* Supports *versions* of genes, e.g. `ENSG00000130203.10` where `.10` indicates this
  is the 10th updated version of this gene
* Previous versions maintained

## Ensembl Gene IDs for Non-humans

* Ensembl Gene IDs have organism-specific conventions:

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
library(knitr)
kable(tribble(
  ~`Gene ID Prefix`, ~Organism, ~Symbol, ~Example,
  "`ENSG`", "Homo sapiens", "HOXA1", "ENSG00000105991",
  "`ENSMUSG`", "Mus musculus (mouse)", "Hoxa1", "ENSMUSG00000029844",
  "`ENSDARG`", "Danio rario (zebrafish)", "hoxa1a", "ENSDARG00000104307",
  "`ENSFCAG`", "Felis catus (cat)", "HOXA1",  "ENSFCAG00000007937",
  "`ENSMMUG`", "Macaca mulata (macaque)", "HOXA1", "ENSMMUG00000012807",
))
```

## Other Identifier Systems

* Ensembl is not the only gene identifier system besides gene symbol
* Entrez Gene IDs (UCSC Gene IDs) used by the [NCBI Gene
  database](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene) are unique integers for each gene
  in each organism
  - APOE in humans is `384`, in mouse `11816`
* Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database has identifiers that look like
  `OMIM:NNNNN`, where each OMIM ID refers to a unique gene or human phenotype
  - APOE is `OMIM:107741`
* UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot are protein sequence databases
  - APOE is `P02649`

## Mapping Between Identifier Systems

* Often must map between identifier systems
* e.g. We have Ensembl Gene ID, but want gene symbols
* Ensembl provides [BioMart](https://www.ensembl.org/biomart/martview) that provides
  gene identifier mappings
* Mappings can be downloaded as CSV files
* Ensembl website has [helpful
  documentation](https://useast.ensembl.org/info/data/biomart/index.html) on how
  to use BioMart to download annotation data

## Biomart in Bioconductor: `biomaRt`

* Ensembl also provides [the `biomaRt` Bioconductor
package](https://useast.ensembl.org/info/data/biomart/biomart_r_package.html)
* Allows programmatic access to the same information directly from R
* There is [much more information in the Ensembl
  databases](https://useast.ensembl.org/info/genome/index.html) than gene
  annotation data that can be accessed via BioMart

## `biomaRt` Example

```r
# this assumes biomaRt is already installed through bioconductor
library(biomaRt)

# the human biomaRt database is named "hsapiens_gene_ensembl"
ensembl <- useEnsembl(biomart="ensembl", dataset="hsapiens_gene_ensembl")
```

## `biomaRt` Example

```r
# listAttributes() returns a data frame, convert to tibble
as_tibble(listAttributes(ensembl))
# A tibble: 3,143 x 3
   name                          description                  page        
   <chr>                         <chr>                        <chr>       
 1 ensembl_gene_id               Gene stable ID               feature_page
 2 ensembl_gene_id_version       Gene stable ID version       feature_page
 3 ensembl_transcript_id         Transcript stable ID         feature_page
 4 ensembl_transcript_id_version Transcript stable ID version feature_page
 5 ensembl_peptide_id            Protein stable ID            feature_page
 6 ensembl_peptide_id_version    Protein stable ID version    feature_page
 7 ensembl_exon_id               Exon stable ID               feature_page
 8 description                   Gene description             feature_page
 9 chromosome_name               Chromosome/scaffold name     feature_page
10 start_position                Gene start (bp)              feature_page
# ... with 3,133 more rows
```

## `biomaRt` Example

* `name` column provides programmatic name associated with the attribute
that can be used to retrieve that annotation information using the `getBM()`
function:

```r
# create a tibble with ensembl gene ID, HGNC gene symbol, and gene description
gene_map <- as_tibble(
  getBM(
    attributes=c("ensembl_gene_id", "hgnc_symbol", "description"),
    mart=ensembl
  )
)
```

## `biomaRt` Example

```r
gene_map
# A tibble: 68,012 x 3
   ensembl_gene_id hgnc_symbol description                                                               
   <chr>           <chr>       <chr>

# ... with 68,002 more rows
```

## Mapping Homologs

* Many organisms share evolutionarily conserved genes (i.e. homologs)
* `biomaRt` links identifiers by explicitly [connecting
  different biomaRt
  databases](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/biomaRt/inst/doc/accessing_ensembl.html#given-the-human-gene-tp53-retrieve-the-human-chromosomal-location-of-this-gene-and-also-retrieve-the-chromosomal-location-and-refseq-id-of-its-homolog-in-mouse.)
  with the `getLDS()` function:

  ```r
  human_db <- useEnsembl("ensembl", dataset = "hsapiens_gene_ensembl")
  mouse_db <- useEnsembl("ensembl", dataset = "mmusculus_gene_ensembl")
  orth_map <- as_tibble(
    getLDS(attributes = c("ensembl_gene_id", "hgnc_symbol"),
         mart = human_db,
         attributesL = c("ensembl_gene_id", "mgi_symbol"),
         martL = mouse_db
    )
)
```

## Mapping Homologs

```r
orth_map
# A tibble: 26,390 x 4
   Gene.stable.ID  HGNC.symbol Gene.stable.ID.1   MGI.symbol
   <chr>           <chr>       <chr>              <chr>

# ... with 26,380 more rows
```

## Alternative: `AnnotationDbi`

* BioMart/biomaRt is not the only ways to map different gene identifiers
* [AnnotateDbi](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/AnnotationDbi.html)
  provides gene identifier mapping independent of Ensembl
* Also includes identifiers from technology platforms, e.g. probe set IDs from [microarrays](#microarrays)
* Also allows comprehensive and flexible homolog mapping
