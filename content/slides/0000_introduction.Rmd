# Introduction | The Beginning

<div class="notes">
Since the publication of the first draft human genome in 2001, data has driven
biological discovery at an exponential rate. Rapid technological innovations in
data-generating biochemical instruments, computational resource availability,
data storage, and analytical approaches including artificial intelligence,
machine learning, and data science more generally have combined and synergized
to enable advances in our understanding of biological systems by orders of
magnitude. As the rate of development of these technologies has increased, so
are practitioners of biological inquiry expected to keep up with the rapidly
expanding set of knowledge, skills, and tools required to use them.
</div>

# Introduction | Domains

<div class="notes">
Modern biological data analysis entails combining knowledge and skills from
many domains, including not only biological concepts like molecular biology,
genetics, genomics, and biochemistry, but also in computational and quantitative
skills including statistics, mathematics, programming and software engineering,
high performance and cloud computing, data visualization, and computer science.
No one person can be expert in all of these areas, but modern software tools and
packages made available by subject matter experts enable us to perform cutting
edge analysis with a conceptual understanding of the topics.
</div>

# Introduction | The R Programming Language

<div class="notes">
One such tool is the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org), a
statistical programming language and environment specifically designed to run
statistical analyses and visualize data. Today
R is one of the two most popular programming languages in biological data
analysis and bioinformatics (the other being [python](https://python.org)).
</div>

# Introduction | tidyverse

<div class="notes">
A major innovation in the R language came with the introduction of the
[tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), as set of open-source data manipulation and
visualization packages, first developed by [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/)
and now improved, supported, and maintained by his team of data scientists and
software engineers and other individuals. The tidyverse is a collection of
packages that specialize in different aspects of data manipulation with the goal
of enabling powerful, consistent, and accurate data operations in the broad
field of data science. While not changing the structure of the language *per
se*, the tidyverse packages define a set of consistent programming conventions
and patterns that are tailored to the types of manipulations required to make
data "tidy" and, therefore, easier and more consistent to work with. The
tidyverse therefore is something of its own "language" that is compatible with
but distinct in convention from the base R language.

# Introduction | This Class

<div class="notes">
This book and accompanying course focus on how to use R and its related package
ecosystems to analyze, visualize, and communicate biological data analyses. As
noted above, effective biological data analysis employs skills that span several
knowledge domains. This book covers many of these topics in relatively shallow
depth, but with the intent of presenting just enough in each to enable the
learner to become proficient in most day-to-day biological analysis tasks.

## Who This Book Is For

You are: a practicing biologist wishing to learn how to use R to analyze
biological data

We assume a basic working knowledge of:

* genetics
* genomics
* molecular biology
* biochemistry
* statistics

We endeavor to explain required background whenever possible to relax these
assumptions
