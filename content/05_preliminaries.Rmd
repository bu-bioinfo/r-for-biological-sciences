# Preliminaries

## The R Language {#prelim-r}

R is a free programming language and environment where that language can be
used. More specifically, R is a *statistical* programming language, designed
for the express and exclusive purpose of conducting statistical analyses and
visualizing data. Said differently, *R is not a general purpose programming
language* unlike other languages such as python, Java, C, etc. As such, the
language's real strengths are in the manipulation, analysis, and visualization
of data and statistical procedures, though it is often used for other purposes
(for example, web applications with [RShiny], or writing books like this one
with [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/)). You may download R for
free from the [Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cloud.r-project.org/).

::: {.box .note}

The effective biological analysis practitioner knows how to use multiple tools
for their appropriate purposes. The most common programming languages in this
field are [python](https://www.python.org), R, and scripting languages like
[The Bourne Again Shell - bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/). While it is
beyond the scope of this book to cover which tools are best used where, R is
appropriate wherever data analysis and visualization are needed. Any operations
that do not involve these aspects (e.g. manipulating text files, programming web
servers, etc) are likely more suitable  for other languages and software.

## RStudio

This course assumes the learner is using the [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)
software platform for all analyses, unless otherwise noted. RStudio is a freely
available and fully featured integrated development environment (IDE) for R, and
has many convenient capabilities when learning R. RStudio may be downloaded and
installed for free from the site above.

::: {.box .important}
By default, RStudio preserves your R environment when you shut it down and
restores it when you start it again.

**This is very bad practice!**

The state of your R environment, which includes
the values stored in variables, the R packages loaded, etc. from previously
executed code is transient and may not reflect the results your code produces
when run alone.

Open the Tools > Global Options... menu and:
1. Uncheck "Restore .RData into workspace at startup"
2. Set "Save workspace to .RData on exit:" to "Never"

The book R for Data Science has an [excellent
chapter](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html#workflow-projects) on why
this is a problem and how to change the RStudio setting to avoid it.

## git + github

### Motivation

Biological analysis entails writing code, which changes over time as you
develop it, gain insight from your data, and identify new questions and
hypotheses. A common pattern when developing scripts is to make copies of older
code files to preserve them before making new changes to them. While it is a
good idea to maintain a record of all the code you previously ran, over time
this practice often leads to disorganized, cluttered, untidy analysis
directories.

For example, say you are working on a script named ``my_R_script.R`` and decide
you want to add a new analysis that substantially changes the code. You might be
tempted to make a copy of the current version of the code into a new file
named ``my_R_script_v2.R`` that you then make changes to, leaving your original
script intact and untouched going forward. You make your changes to your new
script, produce some stunning and fascinating plots, present the analysis at a
group meeting, only to discover later there was a critical bug in your code that
made the plots misleading and requires substantial redevelopment.

::: {.box .note}
**Bugs happen.** There are two types of bugs:

1. Syntax bugs: bugs due to incorrect language usage, which R will tell you
   about and can (usually) be easily identified and fixed
2. Logic bugs: the code you write is syntactically correct, but does something
   other than what you intend

**Bugs are normal.** The scenario described above, where you present results only to
discover your code wasn't doing what you thought it was doing, is extremely
common and *it will happen to you*. This is normal, and finding a bug in your
code does not mean you are a bad programmer.
:::

Rather than edit your version 2 of your script directly, you decide it is
sensible to copy the file to ``my_R_script_v2_BAD.R`` and edit the version 2
script to fix the bug. You are satisfied with your new version 2 script, and so
make a new copy ``my_R_script_v2_final.R``. Upon review of your analysis, you
are asked to implement new changes to the script based on reviewer feedback. You
make a new copy of your script to ``my_R_script_v2_final_revision.R`` and make
the requested changes. Perhaps now your script is final, but in your directory
you now have five different versions of your analysis:

```
my_R_script.R
my_R_script_v2.R
my_R_script_v2_BAD.R
my_R_script_v2_final.R
my_R_script_v2_final_revision.R
```

When you write your code, you may know which scripts are which, and if you
follow [good programming practice](#prog-style) and carefully commented your
code you or your successors may be able to sleuth what was done. However, as
time passes, the intimate knowledge you thought you had about your code will be
replaced by other more immediately important things; eventually you may not even
understand or even recognize your own code, let alone someone else trying to
understand it. Not an ideal situation in any case. A better solution involves
recording changes to code over time in such a way that you can recover old code
if needed, but don't clutter your analytical workspace with unneeded files.
``git`` provides an efficient solution to this problem.

### git

[git](https://git-scm.com/) is a free, open source [version
control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) software program.
Version control software is used to track and record changes to code over time,
potentially by many developers working on the same software project
concurrently from different parts of the world. The base git software can be
used on the command line, or with [graphical user interface
applications](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis) for popular operating systems.

There are many excellent tutorials online (some linked below) that teach how to
use ``git`` but the basic concepts are described below. The command line
commands are listed, but the same operations apply in the graphical clients.

* A **repository (or repo)** is a collection of files in a directory that you
  have asked git to track (run ``git init`` in a new directory)
* Each file you wish to track must be explicitly added to the repo (run
  ``git add <filename>`` from within the git repo directory)
* When you modify a tracked file, git will notice those differences and show
  them to you with ``git status``
* You may tell git to track the changes to the explicit files that changed (also
  run ``git add <filename>`` to record changes)
* A set of tracked changes is stored in the repo by making a **commit**.
  A commit takes a snapshot of all the tracked files in the repo at the
  time the commit is made (run ``git commit -c <commit message>`` with a concise
  commit message that describes what was done)
* Each commit has a date and time associated with it. The files in the
  repo can be reset to exactly the state they were in at any commit,
  thus preserving all previous versions of code.

For the vast majority of use cases, the ``git init``, ``git status``, ``git
add``, and ``git commit`` operations are all you will need to use git
effectively. Two more commands, ``git push`` and ``git pull`` are needed when
sharing your code with others as described in the next section.

### Git hosting platforms (GitHub)

The basic git software only works on your local computer with local
repositories. To share this code with others, and receive others' contributions,
a copy of the repo must be made available in a centralized location that
everyone can access. One such place is [github.com](https://github.com), which
is a free web application that hosts git repos.
[bitbucket.org](https://bitbucket.org) is another popular free git repo hosting
service. These two services are practically the same, so we will focus on
GitHub.

::: {.box .note}
There is no formal relationship between git and GitHub. git is an open source
software project maintained by hundreds of developers around the world (and is
[hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/git/git)). GitHub is an independently
provided web service and application. The only connection between GitHub and git
is that GitHub hosts git repos.
:::

As with git, there are many excellent tutorials on how to use GitHub, but the
basic concepts are described below.

* First you must create an account on GitHub if you don't have one already
* Then, create a new repo on GitHub that you wish to contain your code

The next step depends on whether you have an existing local repo or not:

* *If you do not already have a local git repo:* Follow the instructions on
  GitHub to ``clone`` your GitHub repo and create a local copy that is connected
  to the one on GitHub
* *If you already have a local git repo:* Follow the instructions on the GitHub
  to connect your local repo to the GitHub one (this is called "adding a
  remote")

Now, your local repo is connected to the same repo on GitHub, and the changes
you make to your local files can be sent, or ``push``ed to the repo on GitHub:

* Make changes to your local files, and ``git add`` and ``git commit`` them as
  above
* Update the remote repo on GitHub by pushing your local commits with ``git
  push``
* Running ``git status`` will indicate whether your local repo is up to date
  with your remote GitHub repo

When you are working on a team of contributors to a GitHub repo, your local
files will become out of date as others push their changes. To ensure your local
repo is up to date with the GitHub repo, you must ``pull`` your changes from
GitHub with ``git pull``.

::: {.box .note}
git was designed to automatically combine changes made to a code base by
different developers whenever possible. However, if two people make changes to
the same parts of the same file, git may not be able to resolve those changes
on its own and the developers must communicate and decide what the code should
be. These instances are called *merge conflicts* and can be challenging to
resolve. Dealing with merge conflicts is beyond the scope of this book, but
some resources are linked below for further reading.
