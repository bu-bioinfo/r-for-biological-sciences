              in specifying regional identity in nearly every bilateral animal.
              The birth of HOX gene cluster and its subsequent evolution,
              either in regulation or function, underlie the evolution of many
              bilaterian features and hence to the evolutionary radiation of
              this group. Despite of this importance, evolution of HOX cluster
              in vertebrates remains largely obscure because the phylogenetic
              history of these genes is poorly resolved. This has led to the
              controversy about whether four HOX clusters in human originated
              through two rounds (2R) of whole-genome duplications or instead
              evolved by small-scale events early in vertebrate evolution.
              Recently, the large-scale phylogenetic analysis of triplicate and
              quadruplicate paralogous regions residing on human HOX-bearing
              chromosomes provided an unprecedented insight into events that
              shaped vertebrate genome early in their history. Based on these
              data and comparative genomic analysis of fruit fly, red floor
              beetle, and human, this study infers the genic content of minimal
              HOX locus in the Urbilaterian and reconstructs its duplication
              history. It appears that four HOX clusters of humans are not
              remnants of polyploidy events in vertebrate ancestry. Rather,
              current evidence suggests that one-to-four transition in HOX
              cluster number occurred by three-step sequential process
              involving regional duplication events. Therefore, it is concluded
              that the evolutionary origin of vertebrate novelties, including
              the complexity of their body, is the consequence of small-scale
              genetic changes at widely different times over their history.",

              display some familiar features of the perfect match and mismatch
              probe (PM and MM) values of these data, and examine the
              variance-mean relationship with probe-level data from probes

              explain why we need to normalize the arrays to one another using

              selection) before sequencing. Comparisons between the two methods
              have been carried out by various groups, but the assessments have
              relied largely on non-clinical samples. In this study, we
              evaluated these two RNA sequencing approaches using human blood
              and colon tissue samples. Our analyses showed that rRNA depletion
              captured more unique transcriptome features, whereas polyA+
              selection outperformed rRNA depletion with higher exonic coverage
              and better accuracy of gene quantification. For blood- and
              colon-derived RNAs, we found that 220\% and 50\% more reads,

              hearts in response to injury, but this potential is lost after
              the first week of life. The transcriptional changes that underpin
              mammalian cardiac regeneration have not been fully characterized
              at the molecular level. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of our study
              were to determine whether myocytes revert the transcriptional
              phenotype to a less differentiated state during regeneration and
              to systematically interrogate the transcriptional data to
              identify and validate potential regulators of this process.
              METHODS AND RESULTS: We derived a core transcriptional signature
              of injury-induced cardiac myocyte (CM) regeneration in mouse by
              comparing global transcriptional programs in a dynamic model of
              in vitro and in vivo CM differentiation, in vitro CM explant
              model, as well as a neonatal heart resection model. The
              regenerating mouse heart revealed a transcriptional reversion of
              CM differentiation processes, including reactivation of latent
              developmental programs similar to those observed during
              destabilization of a mature CM phenotype in the explant model. We
              identified potential upstream regulators of the core network,
              including interleukin 13, which induced CM cell cycle entry and
              STAT6/STAT3 signaling in vitro. We demonstrate that
              STAT3/periostin and STAT6 signaling are critical mediators of
              interleukin 13 signaling in CMs. These downstream signaling
              molecules are also modulated in the regenerating mouse heart.
              CONCLUSIONS: Our work reveals new insights into the
              transcriptional regulation of mammalian cardiac regeneration and
              provides the founding circuitry for identifying potential
              regulators for stimulating heart regeneration.",

  abstract = "Statistical analyses are an integral component of scientific
              research, and for decades, biologists have applied
              transformations to data to meet the normal error assumptions for
              F and t tests. Over the years, there has been a movement from
              data transformation toward model reformation-the use of
              non-normal error structures within the framework of the
              generalized linear model (GLM). The principal advantage of model
              reformation is that parameters are estimated on the original,
              rather than the transformed scale. However, data transformation
              has been shown to give better control over type I error, for
              simulated data with known error structures. We conducted a
              literature review of statistical textbooks directed toward
              biologists and of journal articles published in the primary
              literature to determine temporal trends in both the text
              recommendations and the practice in the refereed literature over
              the past 35 years. In this review, a trend of increasing use of
              reformation in the primary literature was evident, moving from no
              use of reformation before 1996 to >50\% of the articles reviewed
              applying GLM after 2006. However, no such trend was observed in
              the recommendations in statistical textbooks. We then undertook
              12 analyses based on published datasets in which we compared the
              type I error estimates, residual plot diagnostics, and
              coefficients yielded by analyses using square root
              transformations, log transformations, and the GLM. All analyses
              yielded acceptable residual versus fit plots and had similar
              p-values within each analysis, but as expected, the coefficient
              estimates differed substantially. Furthermore, no consensus could
              be found in the literature regarding a procedure to
              back-transform the coefficient estimates obtained from linear
              models performed on transformed datasets. This lack of

  abstract  = "[The subject of graphical methods for data analysis and for data
               presentation needs a scientific foundation. In this article we
               take a few steps in the direction of establishing such a
               foundation. Our approach is based on graphical perception-the
               visual decoding of information encoded on graphs-and it includes
               both theory and experimentation to test the theory. The theory
               deals with a small but important piece of the whole process of
               graphical perception. The first part is an identification of a
               set of elementary perceptual tasks that are carried out when
               people extract quantitative information from graphs. The second
               part is an ordering of the tasks on the basis of how accurately
               people perform them. Elements of the theory are tested by
               experimentation in which subjects record their judgments of the
               quantitative information on graphs. The experiments validate
               these elements but also suggest that the set of elementary tasks
               should be expanded. The theory provides a guideline for graph
               construction: Graphs should employ elementary tasks as high in
               the ordering as possible. This principle is applied to a variety
               of graphs, including bar charts, divided bar charts, pie charts,
               and statistical maps with shading. The conclusion is that
               radical surgery on these popular graphs is needed, and as
               replacements we offer alternative graphical forms-dot charts,
               dot charts with grouping, and framed-rectangle charts.]",
