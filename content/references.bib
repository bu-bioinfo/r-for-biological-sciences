  title    = "Diversification of four human {HOX} gene clusters by step-wise
              evolution rather than ancient whole-genome duplications",
  author   = "Abbasi, Amir Ali",
  abstract = "HOX genes encode transcriptional factors that play a pivotal role
              in specifying regional identity in nearly every bilateral animal.
              The birth of HOX gene cluster and its subsequent evolution,
              either in regulation or function, underlie the evolution of many
              bilaterian features and hence to the evolutionary radiation of
              this group. Despite of this importance, evolution of HOX cluster
              in vertebrates remains largely obscure because the phylogenetic
              history of these genes is poorly resolved. This has led to the
              controversy about whether four HOX clusters in human originated
              through two rounds (2R) of whole-genome duplications or instead
              evolved by small-scale events early in vertebrate evolution.
              Recently, the large-scale phylogenetic analysis of triplicate and
              quadruplicate paralogous regions residing on human HOX-bearing
              chromosomes provided an unprecedented insight into events that
              shaped vertebrate genome early in their history. Based on these
              data and comparative genomic analysis of fruit fly, red floor
              beetle, and human, this study infers the genic content of minimal
              HOX locus in the Urbilaterian and reconstructs its duplication
              history. It appears that four HOX clusters of humans are not
              remnants of polyploidy events in vertebrate ancestry. Rather,
              current evidence suggests that one-to-four transition in HOX
              cluster number occurred by three-step sequential process
              involving regional duplication events. Therefore, it is concluded
              that the evolutionary origin of vertebrate novelties, including
              the complexity of their body, is the consequence of small-scale
              genetic changes at widely different times over their history.",

              simultaneously monitoring the expression levels of a large number

              represent genes, the quantification of hybridization, and data

              spotted or synthesized on the glass slides through several
              aspects: sources of probes, the criteria for selecting probes,
              tools available for probe selections, and probes used in
              commercial microarray chips. We then provide a detailed review of
              one type of DNA microarray: Affymetrix GeneChips, discuss the
              need to re-annotate probes, review different methods for
              regrouping probes into probe sets, and compare various

  abstract = "In this paper we report exploratory analyses of high-density
              oligonucleotide array data from the Affymetrix GeneChip system
              with the objective of improving upon currently used measures of
              gene expression. Our analyses make use of three data sets: a
              small experimental study consisting of five MGU74A mouse GeneChip
              arrays, part of the data from an extensive spike-in study
              conducted by Gene Logic and Wyeth's Genetics Institute involving
              95 HG-U95A human GeneChip arrays; and part of a dilution study
              conducted by Gene Logic involving 75 HG-U95A GeneChip arrays. We
              display some familiar features of the perfect match and mismatch
              probe (PM and MM) values of these data, and examine the
              variance-mean relationship with probe-level data from probes
              believed to be defective, and so delivering noise only. We
              explain why we need to normalize the arrays to one another using
              probe level intensities. We then examine the behavior of the PM
              and MM using spike-in data and assess three commonly used summary
              measures: Affymetrix's (i) average difference (AvDiff) and (ii)
              MAS 5.0 signal, and (iii) the Li and Wong multiplicative
              model-based expression index (MBEI). The exploratory data
              analyses of the probe level data motivate a new summary measure
              that is a robust multi-array average (RMA) of
              background-adjusted, normalized, and log-transformed PM values.
              We evaluate the four expression summary measures using the
              dilution study data, assessing their behavior in terms of bias,
              variance and (for MBEI and RMA) model fit. Finally, we evaluate
              the algorithms in terms of their ability to detect known levels
              of differential expression using the spike-in data. We conclude
              that there is no obvious downside to using RMA and attaching a
              standard error (SE) to this quantity using a linear model which
              removes probe-specific affinities.",
