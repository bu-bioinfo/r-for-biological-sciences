@ARTICLE{Abbasi2015-rn,
  title    = "Diversification of four human {HOX} gene clusters by step-wise
              evolution rather than ancient whole-genome duplications",
  author   = "Abbasi, Amir Ali",
  abstract = "HOX genes encode transcriptional factors that play a pivotal role
              in specifying regional identity in nearly every bilateral animal.
              The birth of HOX gene cluster and its subsequent evolution,
              either in regulation or function, underlie the evolution of many
              bilaterian features and hence to the evolutionary radiation of
              this group. Despite of this importance, evolution of HOX cluster
              in vertebrates remains largely obscure because the phylogenetic
              history of these genes is poorly resolved. This has led to the
              controversy about whether four HOX clusters in human originated
              through two rounds (2R) of whole-genome duplications or instead
              evolved by small-scale events early in vertebrate evolution.
              Recently, the large-scale phylogenetic analysis of triplicate and
              quadruplicate paralogous regions residing on human HOX-bearing
              chromosomes provided an unprecedented insight into events that
              shaped vertebrate genome early in their history. Based on these
              data and comparative genomic analysis of fruit fly, red floor
              beetle, and human, this study infers the genic content of minimal
              HOX locus in the Urbilaterian and reconstructs its duplication
              history. It appears that four HOX clusters of humans are not
              remnants of polyploidy events in vertebrate ancestry. Rather,
              current evidence suggests that one-to-four transition in HOX
              cluster number occurred by three-step sequential process
              involving regional duplication events. Therefore, it is concluded
              that the evolutionary origin of vertebrate novelties, including
              the complexity of their body, is the consequence of small-scale
              genetic changes at widely different times over their history.",
