# Introduction & Overview

Since the publication of the first draft human genome in 2001, data has driven
biological discovery at an exponential rate. Rapid technological innovations in
data generating biochemical instruments, computational resource availability,
data storage, and analytical approaches including artificial intelligence,
machine learning, and data science more generally have combined and synergized
to enable advances in our understanding of biological systems by orders of
magnitude. As the rate of development of these technologies has increased, so
are practitioners of biological inquiry expected to keep up with the rapidly
expanding set of knowledge, skills, and tools required to use them.

Modern biological data analysis entails combining knowledge and skills from
many domains, including not only biological concepts like molecular biology,
genetics, genomics, and biochemistry, but also in computational and quantitative
skills including statistics, mathematics, programming and software engineering,
high performance and cloud computing, data visualization, and computer science.
No one person can be expert in all of these areas, but modern software tools
and packages made available by subject matter experts allow us the ability to
perform cutting edge analysis with a conceptual understanding of the topics.

One such tool is the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org), a
statistical programming language and environment specifically designed to run
statistical analyses and models and visualize data. R became popular in
biological data analysis in the early to mid 2000s, when [microarray technology](https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Microarray-Technology)
came into widespread use enabling researchers to look for statistical
differences in gene expression for thousands of genes across large numbers of
samples. As a result of this popularity, a community of biological researchers
and data analysts created a collection of software packages called [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/), which made a vast array of
cutting edge statistical and bioinformatic methodologies widely available. Today
R is one of the two most popular programming languages in biological data
analysis and bioinformatics (the other being [python](https://python.org)).

A major innovation in the R language came with the introduction of the
[tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) set of data manipulation and
visualization packages by [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/). The tidyverse
is a collection of packages that specialize in different aspects of data
manipulation with the goal of enabling powerful, consistent, and accurate
data operations in the broad field of data science. While not changing the
structure of the language *per se*, the tidyverse packages define a set of
consistent programming conventions and patterns that are tailored to the
types of manipulations required to make data "tidy" and, therefore, easier
and more consistent to work with. The tidyverse therefore is something of its
own "language" that is compatible with but distinct from the base R language.

This book and accompanying course focus on how to use R and its related package
ecosystems to analyze, visualize, and communicate biological data analyses. As
noted above, effective biological data analysis employs skills that span several
knowledge domains. This book covers many of these topics in relatively shallow
depth, but with the intent of presenting just enough in each to enable the
learner to become proficient in most day-to-day biological analysis tasks.
