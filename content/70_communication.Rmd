# Communicating with R

No matter what your job is, you will at some point need to communicate the
findings of your analysis with others. This will usually entail a combination of
different forms of communication, including text, tables, and visualizations
like plots. Depending on your audience, communicating may also include your
code which describes very precisely (and ideally,
[reproducibly](#eng-reproducibility)) what you did in your analysis. This
chapter describes a few tools and techniques you can use to create static
reports that help you communicate in all these ways.

## RMarkdown & knitr

A [markup language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language) is a special
kind of programming language used to annotate and decorate plain text with
information about its intended formatting and structure. The syntax of a markup
language is intended to be easy to read and write by humans and also machine
readable, so that it may be processed by formatting programs into different
formats, e.g. the same markup text might be converted into HTML or PDF.

[markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is one such markup
language. The markup is simple, and provides basic formatting syntax by default.
The following contains some examples of markdown syntax:

```
You can *emphasize* text, or **really emphasize it**. Lists are pretty easy to
read as well:

* item 1
* item 2
* item 3

If you need an enumerated list you can do that too:

1. item 1
2. item 2
3. item 3

You can easily include links to web sites like [Google](http://google.com) and
images:
![an image of a master of the
universe](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bc/Juvenile_Ragdoll.jpg){width=50%}
```

The markdown from above might be formatted as follows:

Refer to the [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
documentation for a complete listing of supported markdown syntax.

Some other markup languages you might recognize:

* [ReStructured Text](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html) - the markup language used in most python documentation
* [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) - a markup language designed to help format mathematical expression
* [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) - the web markup language (HyperText Markup Language)
* [wikitext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Wikitext) - the markup language used by Wikipedia

As the name suggests, [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/index.html) is
an extension of markdown that works in R. The most important extension is the
ability to include code blocks in R in between markdown formatted text that can
be executed. This enables writing executable reports that update their results
whenever the document is rerun interspersed with explanatory text and other
descriptive elements. For this reason, RMarkdown files are sometimes called
*RMarkdown notebooks*, because they can be used to record both narrative text
and results, similar to a [traditional lab
notebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lab_notebook). RMarkdown files typically
end with `.Rmd`.

RStudio has full RMarkdown integration to make writing RMarkdown notebooks very
easy. Below is a screenshot of an RMarkdown document loaded in RStudio:

![RMarkdown notebook example](rmarkdown_notebook.png)

The grey lines starting with `` `r '\x60\x60\x60{r}'` `` define a special code
block that contains R code that should be executed and the output placed after
the block. When run, RStudio will show you the output of the notebook within its
interface:

![RMarkdown notebook example after running](rmarkdown_notebook_run.png)

Notice how there is now a plot in the rendered document on the right. The code
within the block was run, the plot generated, and inserted into the report. In
this case, the notebook created an HTML document that RStudio knows how to
display, but could also be opened in a standard web browser.

These blocks are not standard R syntax, but are instead understood and processed
by the [knitr](https://yihui.org/knitr/) R package. As the name suggests, the
process of generating a report from an RMarkdown document is called "knitting";
you would ask RStudio to knit your RMarkdown into a report.

RMarkdown documents can be knitted into many different formats, including HTML,
PDF, Microsoft Word, and even [some slide presentation
formats](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-11.html). When exporting to HTML,
the report may include [interactive
elements](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-14.html) including plots,
collapsible sections, and code blocks, and maps.

RMarkdown documents can also be written to accept
[parameters](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-6.html). This means you can
write a single RMarkdown document that can be run on different inputs.
Reports for standardized analytical pipelines, as are often implemented by
high throughput sequencing cores, can thus be generated trivially for new
datasets as they are generated without writing any additional code.

## bookdown

Another R package that processed RMarkdown documents is
[bookdown](https://bookdown.org/). As the name suggests, this package is
designed to write books using RMarkdown. This book you are reading was written
in RMarkdown and generated using bookdown! You can look at all the [source
code](https://github.com/bu-bioinfo/r_for_biological_sciences) on GitHub.
