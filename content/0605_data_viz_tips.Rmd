## Tips and Tricks .

### Reordering 1-D Data Elements .

How do we enforce an order on elements in a plot? Why might we want to do that?

``` {r}
ad_metadata %>%
arrange(tau) %>%
ggplot(mapping = aes(x=ID,y=tau,fill=condition)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity")
```

But wait, our bars are in the same order as in the previous plot. Sorting our
data prior to plotting did not have the desired effect. The reason is that
although the `ID` column is a character string in our original tibble, ggplot
converts it into a [factor](#prog-factor) prior to plotting. Recall that a
factor is a numeric type composed of sequential integers, each of which having a
character label associated with it.

### Confidence Intervals .

What are some ways to depict uncertainty in a plot?

### Annotations .

How do we add text annotations to plots? Manually vs data-driven.
