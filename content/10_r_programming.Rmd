# R Programming {#prog-basics}

As with other subjects covered so far, the basic syntax of R is covered very
well in other free online materials. Some of those excellent resources are
linked at the end of this section, but a brief overview of the syntax is covered
here. The code examples below can be written into a script and evaluated as
described above or entered on the R Console directly and run by pressing
`Enter`.

## R Syntax Basics

At its core, R (like all programming languages) is basically a fancy calculator.
The syntax of most basic arithmetic operations in R should be familiar to you:

```
1 + 2 # addition
[1] 3
3 - 2 # subtraction
[1] 1
4 * 2 # multiplication
[1] 8
4 / 2 # division
[1] 2
1.234 + 2.345 - 3.5*4.9 # numbers can have decimals
[1] -13.571
1.234 + (2.345 - 3.5)*4.9 # expressions can contain parentheses
[1] -4.4255
2**2 # exponentiation
[1] 4
4**(1/2) # square root
[1] 2
9**(1/3) # cube root
[1] 3
```
The `[1]` lines above are the output given by R when the preceding expression
is executed. Any portion of a line starting with a `#` is a comment and ignored
by R.

R also supports storing values into symbolic placeholders called *variables*, or
*objects*. An expression like those above can be assigned into a variable with a
name using the `<-` operator:

```{r, results='hide'}
new_var <- 1 + 2
```

Variables that have been assigned a value can be placed in subsequent
expressions anywhere where their value is evaluated:

```
new_var - 2
[1] 1
another_var <- new_var * 4
```

::: {.box .note}
The correct way to assign a value to a variable in R is with the `<-` syntax,
unlike many other programming languages which use `=`. However, although the `=`
assignment syntax does work in R:

```{r}
new_var = 2 # works, but is not common convention!
```
this is considered bad practice and may cause confusion later. You should always
use the `<-` syntax when assigning values to variables!
:::

::: {.box .note}
In R, the period `.` does not have a special meaning like it does in many other
languages like python, C, javascript, etc. Therefore, `new.var` is a valid
variable name just like `new_var`, even though it may look strange to those
familiar with these other languages. While including `.` in your R variable
names is valid, the results that you will use in programs written in other
languages that do have a meaning for this character. Therefore, it is good
practice to avoid using `.` characters in your variable names to reduce the
chances of conflicts later.

## Basic Types of Values {#prog-types}

The most common type of value in R is the number, e.g. `1.0` or `1e-5` for
$10^{-5}$. For most practical purposes, R does not distinguish between numbers
with fractional parts (e.g. `1.123`) and integers (e.g. `1`); a number is a
number. In addition to numbers, there are some other types of values that are
special in R:

* **logical or boolean values** - `TRUE` or `FALSE`. Internally, R stores `TRUE`
as the number `1` and `FALSE` as the number `0`. Generally, R interprets
non-zero numbers as `TRUE` and `0` as `FALSE`, but it is good practice to supply
the tokens `TRUE` or `FALSE` when an argument expects a logical value.
* **missing values** - `NA`. `NA` is a special value that indicates a value is
missing.
* **missing vectors** - `NULL`. Similar to `NA`, `NULL` indicates that a vector,
rather than a value, is missing. Vectors will be described in the [next section
on data strutures](prog-struct).
* **factors** - Factors are a complex type used in statistical models and are
covered in [greater detail later](ds-model)
* **infinity** - `Inf` and `-Inf`. These values encode what R understands to be
positive or negative infinity, or any number divided by `0`.
* **impossible values** - `NaN`. This value corresponds to the mathematically
'impossible' or undefined value of `0/0`.
* **character data** - `"value"`. R can store character data in the form of
strings. Note R does not interpret string values by default, so `"1"` and `1`
are distinct.
* **dates and times** - R has a basic type to store dates and times (together
termed a *datetime*, which includes both components). Internally, R stores
datetimes as the fractional number of days since January 1, 1970, using negative
numbers for earlier dates.
* **complex numbers** - R can store complex numbers using the `complex`
function.

::: {.box .warning}
Unsurprisingly, R cannot perform computations on `NA`, `NaN`, or `Inf` values.
Each of these values have an 'infectious' quality to them, where if they are
mixed in with other values, the result of the computation reverts to the first
of these values encountered:

```
# this how to create a vector of 4 values in R
x <- c(1,2,3,NA)
mean(x) # compute the mean of values that includes NA
[1] NA
mean(x,na.rm=TRUE) # remove NA values prior to computing mean
[1] 2
mean(c(1,2,3,NaN))
[1] NaN
mean(c(NA,NaN,1))
[1] NA
```

If your code produces values that are not numbers as you expect, this suggests
there are one of these values in your input, and need to be handled explicitly.

## Data Structures {#prog-struct}

### Vectors

Data structures in R (and other languages) are ways of storing and organizing
more than one value together. The most basic data structure in R is a one
dimensional sequence of values called a
[vector](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/vector):

```
# the c() function creates a vector
x <- c(1,2,3)
[1] 1 2 3
```
The vector in R has a special property that all values contained in the vector
must have the same type, from the list [described above](#prog-types). When
constructing a vector, R will [coerce
values](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/r-objects.html#coercion) to the
most general type if it encounters values of different types:

```
c(1,2,"3")
[1] "1" "2" "3"
c(1,2,TRUE,FALSE)
[1] 1 2 1 0
c(1,2,NA) # note missing values stay missing
[1] 1 2 NA
c("1",2,NA,NaN) # NA stays, NaN is cast to a character type
[1] "1" "2" NA "NaN"
```

In addition to having a single type, vectors also have a length, which is
defined as the number of elements in the vector:

```
x <- c(1,2,3)
length(x)
[1] 3
```

Internally, R is much more efficient at operating on vectors than individual
elements separately. With numeric vectors, you can perform arithmetic operations
on vectors of compatible size just as easily as individual values:

```
c(1,2) + c(3,4)
[1] 4 6
c(1,2) * c(3,4)
[1] 3 8
c(1,2) * c(3,4,5) # operating on vectors of different lengths raises warning, but still works
[1] 3 8 5
Warning message:
In c(1, 2) * c(3, 4, 5) :
  longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object length
```

::: {.box .warning}
In the example above, we multiplied a vector of length 2 with a vector of length
3:

```
c(1,2) * c(3,4,5) # operating on vectors of different lengths raises warning, but still works
[1] 3 8 5
Warning message:
In c(1, 2) * c(3, 4, 5) :
  longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object length
```

Rather than raise an error and aborting, R merely emits a warning message about
the vectors not having divisible lengths. So how did R decide the third value
should be 5? Because R cycles through each vector and multiplies the values
element-wise until the longest vector has had an operation performed on all its
values:

```
c(1,2) * c(3,4,5) # yields: 1*3 2*4 1*5
[1] 3 8 5
Warning message:
In c(1, 2) * c(3, 4, 5) :
  longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object length
c(1,2) * c(3,4,5,6) # yields: 1*3 2*4 1*5 2*6
[1] 3 8 5 12
```

R will sometimes work in ways you don't expect. Be careful to read warnings and
check that your code does what you expect!
:::

### Matrices

A matrix in R is simply the 2 dimensional version of a vector. That is, it is
a rectangle of values that all have the same type, e.g. number, character,
logical, etc. A matrix may be constructed using the vector notation described
above and specifying the number of rows and columns the matrix should have, and
Instead of having a length like a vector, it has $m \times n$ dimensions:

```
# create a matrix with two rows and three columns containing integers
A <- matrix(c(1,2,3,4,5,6)
       nrow = 2, ncol = 3, byrow=1
      )
A
[,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]    1    2    3
[2,]    4    5    6
dim(A) # the dim function prints out the dimensions of the matrix, rows first
[1] 2 3
```

Because a matrix is 2 dimensional, it can be transposed from $m \times n$ to be
$n \times m$ using the `t()` function:

```
# A defined above as a 2 x 3 matrix
t(A)
[,1] [,2]
[1,]    1    4
[2,]    2    5
[3,]    3    6
dim(t(A))
[1] 3 2
```

### Lists and data frames

## Logical Tests and Comparators

As mentioned above, R recognizes logical values as a distinct type. R provides
all the conventional infix logical operators:

```
1 == 1 # equality
[1] TRUE
1 != 1 # inequality
[1] FALSE
1 < 2 # less than
[1] TRUE
1 > 2 # greater than
[1] FALSE
1 <= 2 # less than or equal to
[1] TRUE
1 >= 2 # greater than or equal to
```

These operators also work on vectors, albeit with the same caveats about vector
length as noted earlier:

```
x <- c(1,2,3)
x == 2
[1] FALSE TRUE FALSE
x < 1
[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE
x < 3
[1] TRUE TRUE FALSE
c(1,2) == c(1,3)
[1] TRUE FALSE
c(1,2) != c(1,3)
[1] FALSE TRUE
c(1,2) == c(1,2,3)
[1] TRUE TRUE FALSE
Warning message:
In c(1, 2, 3) == c(1, 2) :
  longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object length
```

R also provides many functions of the form `is.X` where `X` is some type or
condition (recall that `.` is not a special character in R):

```
is.numeric(1) # is the argument numeric?
[1] TRUE
is.character(1) # is the argument a string?
[1] FALSE
is.character("ABC")
[1] TRUE
is.numeric(c(1,2,3)) # recall a vector has exactly one type
[1] TRUE
is.numeric(c(1,2,"3"))
[1] FALSE
is.na(c(1,2,NA))
[1] FALSE FALSE TRUE
```

## Functions

Just as a variable is a symbolic representation of a value, a function is a
symbolic representation of code. In other words, a function allows you to
substitute a short name, e.g. `mean`, for a set of operations on a given input,
e.g. the sum of a set of numbers divided by the number of numbers. R provides a
[very large number of functions](https://rdrr.io/r/) for common operations in
its default environment, and more functions are provided by packages you can
install separately.

Encapsulating many lines of code into a function is useful for (at least) five
distinct reasons:

1. Make your code more concise and readable
2. Allow you to avoid writing the same code over and over (i.e. reuse it)
3. Allow you to systematically test pieces of your code to make sure they do
   what you intend
4. Allow you to share your code easily with others
5. Program using a functional programming style (see note box below)

::: {.box .note}
At its core, R is a *functional programming language.* The details of what this
means are outside the scope of this book, but as the name implies this refers to
the language being structured around the use of functions. While this property
has technical implications on the structure of the language, a more important
consequence is the style of programming it entails. The functional programming
style (or *paradigm*) has many advantages, including generally producing
programs that are more concise, predictable, provably correct, and performant.
[This tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/functional_programming/index.htm)
provides a good starting point for learning about functional programming.
:::

In order to do anything useful, a function must generally be able to accept
and execute on different inputs; e.g. the `sin` function wouldn't be very useful
if it didn't accept a value! The terminology used in R and many other
programming languages for this is the function must *accept* or allow you to
*pass it arguments.* In R, functions accept arguments using the following
*pattern:

```
# a basic function signature
function_name(arg1, arg2) # function accepts exactly 2 arguments
```

Here, `arg1` and `arg2` are *formal arguments* or *named arguments*, indicating
this function accepts two arguments. The name of the function (i.e.
`function_name`) and the pattern of arguments it accepts is called the
function's *signature.* Every function has at least one signature, and it is
critical to understand it in order to use the function properly.

In the above example, `arg1` and `arg2` are *required* arguments. This means
that the function will not execute without exactly two arguments provided and
will raise an error if you try otherwise:

```
mean() # compute the arithmetic mean, but of what?
Error in mean.default() : argument "x" is missing, with no default
```

How do you know what arguments a function requires? All functions provided by
base R and many other packages include detailed documentation that can be
accessed directly through RStudio using either the `?` or `help()`:

![RStudio - help and function signatures](rstudio_help_fn_sigs.png)

The second signature of the `mean` function introduces two new types of syntax:

**Default argument values** - e.g. `trim = 0`. These are formal arguments that
have a default value if not provided explicitly.

**Variable arguments** - `...`. This means the `mean` function can accept
arguments that are not explicitly listed in the signature.

With these definitions, we can now understand the Arguments section of the help
documentation:

![Arguments to the mean function](rstudio_mean_fn_args.png)

In other words:

* `x` is the vector of values (more on this in the [next section on data
structures](prog-struct)) we wish to compute the arithmetic mean for
* `trim` is a fraction (i.e. a number between 0 and 0.5) that instructs R to
remove a portion of the largest and smallest values from `x` prior to computing
the mean.
* `na.rm` is a logical value (i.e. either `TRUE` or `FALSE`) that instructs R to
remove `NA` values from `x` before computing the mean.

::: {.box .note}
All function arguments can be specified by name, regardless of whether there is
a default value or not. For instance, the following two `mean` calls are
equivalent:

```
# this generates 100 normally distributed samples with mean 0 and standard deviation 1
my_vals <- rnorm(100,mean=0,sd=1)
mean(my_vals)
[1] -0.05826857
mean(x=my_vals)
[1] -0.05826857
```

To borrow from [the Zen of
Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/#id2), "Explicit is better than
implicit." Being explicit about which variables are being passed as which
arguments will almost always make your code easier to read and more likely to do
what you intend.
:::

::: {.box .warning}
**The `...` argument catchall can be very dangerous.** It allows you to provide
arguments to a function that have no meaning, and R will not raise an error.
Consider the following call to `mean`:

```
# this generates a vector of 100 normally distributed samples with mean 0 and standard deviation 1
my_vals <- rnorm(100,mean=0,sd=1)
mean(x=my_vals,tirm=0.1)
[1] -0.05826857
```

Did you spot the mistake? The `trim` argument name has been misspelled as
`tirm`, but R did not report an error. Compare the value of mean without the
typo:

```
mean(x=my_vals,trim=0.1)
[1]-0.02139839
```

The value we get is different, because R recognizes `trim` but not `tirm` and
changes its behavior accordingly. Not all functions have the `...` catchall in
their signatures, but many do and so you must be diligent when supplying
arguments to function calls!

### Writing your own functions


### DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself {#prog-dry}


[Don't Repeat Yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)
(DRY) is a principle of software development that emphasizes recognizing and
avoiding writing the same code over and over.

## Coding Style and Conventions {#prog-style}

Some very common worries among new programmers is: "Is my code terrible? How do
I write good code?" There is no gold standard for what makes code "good", but
there are some questions you can ask of your code as a guide:

### Is my code correct?

Does it produce the desired output? This is pretty obviously important in
principle, but it can be difficult to be sure that your code is correct. This is
especially difficult if your codebase is large and complicated as it tends to
become over time. While simple [trial and error](#prog-debugging) is an effective
first approach, a more reliable albeit time- and thought-intensive strategy is
to write [explicit tests](#prog-testing) for your code and run them regularly.

### Does my code follow the [DRY principle](#prog-dry)?

Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a powerful and helpful strategy to make your
code more reliable. This typically involves identifying common patterns in your
code and moving them to functions or objects.

### Did I choose concise but descriptive variable and function names?

### Did I use indentation and naming conventions consistently throughout my code?

### Did I write comments, especially when what the code does is not obvious?

### How easy would it be for someone else to understand my code?

If someone else who has never seen my code before is asked to run and understand
it, how easy would it be for them to do so?

### Is my code easy to maintain/change?

This is related to the previous question, but is distinct in that understanding
what code does is just the first step in being able to make desired changes to
it.
