## Network Analysis .

What is a network? What is network analysis? What are some example network
analysis applications in biology and bioinformatics (there is a full ksection on

How do we represent networks in R, and how do we analyze them? ([Network
visualization] is covered in the data viz chapter, might be helpful to write
these two sections together)
