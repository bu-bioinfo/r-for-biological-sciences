## Single Cell Sequencing Analysis .

### Single Cell Sequencing .

What is the goal of single cell sequencing? How is it generated, and what does
it measure? What questions can we ask of single cell data that we cannot ask of
other types of sequencing data? How is single cell data loaded into R?

### Single Cell Analysis .

What is the general analytical workflow for single cell analysis? Why do we
perform each step along the analysis path? What are key parameters that we must
choose that influence the results? How do we perform single cell analysis in R
(Seurat)?
