### Heatmaps .

Heatmaps visualize values associated with a grid of points $(x,y,z)$, where $x$
and $y$ are coordinates and $z$ is a continuous value. Typically $x$ and $y$ are
evenly spaced between minima and maxima on each axis, but this is not
necessarily the case, where unequal spacing is sometimes used.
