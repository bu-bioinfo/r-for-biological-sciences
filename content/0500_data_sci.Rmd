# Data Science

[Data science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science) is an enormous and
rapidly growing field that incorporates elements of statistics, computer
science, software engineering, high performance and cloud computing, and big
data management, as well as syntheses with knowledge from other social and
physical science fields to model and predict phenomena captured by data
collected from the "real world". Many books have and will be written on this
subject, and this one does not pretend to even attempt to give this area an
adequate treatment. Like the rest of this book, the topics covered here are
opinionated and presented through the lens of a biological analyst practitioner
with enough high level conceptual details and a few general principles to
hopefully be useful in that context.
